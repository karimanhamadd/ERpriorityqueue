# ERpriorityqueue
Implemented an emergency room (ER) priority queue using a linked list data structure in C. The priority queue manages patient arrivals and departures based on defined priorities, where higher priority corresponds to a smaller number. 
Dynamic memory allocation for the linked list is appropriately managed to ensure memory efficiency and prevent memory leaks.
